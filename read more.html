            <h2>HABITAT LOSS</h2>
            <p>
            China’s Yangtze Basin region, which holds the panda’s primary habitat, is the geographic and economic heart of this booming country. 
            Roads and railroads are increasingly fragmenting the forest, which isolates panda populations and prevents mating.
            Forest destruction also reduces pandas’ access to the bamboo they need to survive. The Chinese government has established more than 50 panda reserves, 
            but only around 61% of the country’s panda population is protected by these reserves.
            </p><br>
            <h2>HUNTING</h2>
            <p>
            Hunting remains an ever-present threat. Poaching the animals for their fur has declined due to strict laws and greater public awareness of the panda’s protected status. 
            But hunters seeking other animals in panda habitats continue to kill pandas accidentally.
