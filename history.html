                In 2006, a helicopter carrying WWF staff members Dr. Chandra Gurung, Dr. Harka Gurung, Jennifer Headley, 
                Yeshi Choden Lama, Matthew Preece, Dr. Jillian Bowling Schlaepfer and Mingma Sherpa as well as other conservation leaders crashed in Nepal, 
                killing all 23 passengers on board.

        <h5>Our history</h5>
        <article id="article1">
            <p>
            In 1961, a limited number of organizations around the world—such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) 
            and The Conservation Foundation—were trying to meet conservation needs, but were desperately short of funds.<br>
                
            The first call for broad support was the Morges Manifesto, signed in 1961 by 16 of the world’s leading conservationists, including biologist and African wildlife enthusiast Sir Julian Huxley, 
            IUCN vice president Sir Peter Scott and director-general of the British Nature Conservancy E. M. Nicholson. The Morges Manifesto stated that while the expertise to protect the world environment existed, 
            the financial support to achieve this protection did not. The decision was made to establish World Wildlife Fund as an international fundraising organization to work in collaboration with 
            existing conservation groups and bring substantial financial support to the conservation movement on a worldwide scale.
